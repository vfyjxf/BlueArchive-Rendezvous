## Liscense
	This project follows [Commons Clause License](https://commonsclause.com/) with [AGPL-3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).

	2. Anyone who has referenced this project as dependency, or modified this project, will be enforced to open their source code to the public, and the code must be released under the same license as this project([Commons Clause License with AGPL-3.0](LICENSE.txt)).  
	3. This is **NOT** a [open-source](https://opensource.org/osd) project, anyone **CANNOT** use this mod for any direct commercial purposes, including but not limited to:

### Why use Commons Clause License?
	First of all, our purpose in creating this mod is to allow everyone to play and experience the Minecraft-style BlueArchive for free and immersively.   
	Legally speaking, game manufacturers own the copyrights of the characters, plot settings, etc. of the games they designed. Fan creation and publishing actually infringes on their rights. But now, most game manufacturers tacitly allow non-profit fan creation. As mod developers, we will release the binary files of the mod for free, but we also have to find a way to prevent others from using this mod for any form of profit, which is why this mod uses a strongly restrictive license.   
	Existing open-source licenses all explicitly allow commercial use. Although these licenses may force the disclosure of source code, they cannot prevent users from using the binary files of these source codes for sale or providing services for profit, which runs counter to our original intention. [CC-NC License](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/) explicitly prohibits the use of works for any form of commercial purposes, but it is not a license designed for software, and there is no clear definition of matters such as the distribution and modification of source code, and the Creative Commons organization does not recommend it as a software license. To this end, we chose the Commons Clause License, which is based on other open-source licenses and only explicitly prohibits commercial use of the work without changing other terms.  
## Introduction
	This Minecraft mod is a communal fan fiction for [BlueArchive](https://bluearchive.nexon.com), made with love.  
	In this mod, you will play the role of a teacher and come to Kivotos, where you will spend all kinds of daily life with the girls living here. You can choose to teach students all kinds of knowledge in the academy, or take them shopping, dating, going on vacation, and buy gifts for them. At the same time, you also need to explore the world, coordinate the conflicts between the various academies, and reasonably form a team to go out with the students to solve the incident. As time goes by and the situation changes, the deeper secrets behind the world and the crises hidden in the darkness will gradually be revealed. Life is only once, as a qualified adult, please be sure to protect every student.
